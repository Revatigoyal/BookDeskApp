I have Used ChatEngiene.io for this Application 
We can Add as many Users we want 
As I have added 3 users,User1,User2, and User3
We can also create Chat rooms i have created one group chat room (GroupA) for all the Three users and 2 single chat rooms for user1,user2 and user1 ,user3 respectively
the credentials for users are as follows:-
User1    Username:- User1
         Password:- user123
User2    Username:- User2
         Password:- user123
User3    Username:- User3
         Password:- user123
         
Functionality:-
Users can add other users in the chat room by selecting the users above the peoples tab at the right navigation pane type user's name select the user and the user will be added in chat room
Users can chat with each other and also share images in the chat.
The active status is shown while the user is logged in.
